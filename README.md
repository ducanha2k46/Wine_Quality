# WineQuality
## Data Set Information
- The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
## Perform on datasets
- Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!.
- Using linear regression to find good wines.
